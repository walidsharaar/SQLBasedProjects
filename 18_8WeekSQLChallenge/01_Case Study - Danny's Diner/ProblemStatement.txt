**INTRODUCTION**

Danny loves Japanese food and at the beginning of 2021, he decides to take a risky venture and opens a cute restaurant that sells his 3 favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen.
Danny's Diner needs your help to keep the restaurant afloat - the restaurant captured some very basic data from their first few months of operation, but they have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they spend, and which menu items are their favorites. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.

**THERE ARE 3 TABLES:**
- sales
- menu
- members

**QUESTIONS:**

1.  What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2.  How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3.  What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4.  What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5.  Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6.  Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7.  Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8.  What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
